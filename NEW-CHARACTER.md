# Adding A New Character

The process is mostly managed but running the helper script:

```sh
bash new-character.sh [character-slug]
```

for example:

```sh
bash new-character.sh yaggababble
```

You should **avoid** using official artwork for the icons.

Instead it's good to check out `#toolmakers` on the [Unofficial Discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/BloodOnTheClocktower/comments/bk4rqz/bloodontheclocktower_discord_channel_unofficial/)
